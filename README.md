# JavaScript Problem-Solving Guide

## Study Path

### 1. Fundamentals
Start with the building blocks of JavaScript. This is essential to solve even the simplest of problems.

- **Data Types & Variables**  
  Learn about primitive types (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `undefined`, `null`, `symbol`, `bigint`) and how to use `let`, `const`, and `var`.
  
- **Control Structures**  
  Work on conditionals (`if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`) and loops (`for`, `while`, `do...while`).  
  Write problems where you check conditions or iterate over a range of values.

- **Functions**  
  Learn how to define and invoke functions, both regular and arrow functions.  
  Try solving simple problems using functions like reversing a string, calculating factorials, etc.

- **Arrays**  
  Practice with array methods like `.push()`, `.pop()`, `.shift()`, `.unshift()`, `.slice()`, `.splice()`.  
  Write problems where you need to manipulate or iterate over arrays (e.g., finding the sum of an array, finding duplicates).

### 2. Intermediate Topics
Once you’re comfortable with the basics, dive into more complex topics.

- **Objects**  
  Learn how to work with objects: creating, modifying, destructuring, and accessing properties.  
  Try problems where you manage a collection of data using objects (e.g., count the occurrences of each letter in a string).

- **Array Methods**  
  Get comfortable with `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`, `.forEach()`. These are powerful tools for handling arrays.
  Try problems like filtering out odd numbers or mapping over an array of objects to transform them.

- **Higher-Order Functions**  
  Understand how functions can take other functions as arguments and return functions.
  Example problem: Filter out users by age, sort them by name, etc.

### 3. Advanced Concepts
Start diving into more challenging topics that are essential for problem-solving and building real-world apps.

- **ES6+ Features**  
  Study and practice newer JavaScript features like:
  - Template literals
  - Destructuring assignment
  - Default parameters
  - Spread/rest operators
  - Classes
  
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**  
  Learn about Promises, `async`/`await`, and callbacks.  
  Work on problems like handling asynchronous API requests and waiting for multiple promises to resolve.

- **Recursion**  
  Practice solving problems using recursion (e.g., factorials, Fibonacci sequence).
  
- **Error Handling**  
  Understand `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and how to handle errors in asynchronous code.

### 4. Final Projects
Once you’re confident with all these topics, apply your knowledge to bigger projects:

- **Build a Simple App** (Weather App, To-Do List)
- **Create an API** with Node.js (for example, a Book or Movie database API).
- **Build a Game** (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe or a number guessing game).

## Next Steps
1. **Choose a starting topic**: Start by tackling simple problems in basic JavaScript concepts like arrays or functions.  
2. **Set milestones**: Try committing and pushing at least one solution per day.
3. **Mix learning with challenges**: As you study new concepts, immediately apply them to coding challenges. This will reinforce what you learn and help you feel more comfortable with the material.
